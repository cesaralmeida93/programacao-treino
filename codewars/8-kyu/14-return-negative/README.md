# Return Negative

In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

## Example

```go
false xor false == false // since both are false
true xor false == true // exactly one of the two expressions are true
false xor true == true // exactly one of the two expressions are true
true xor true == false // Both are true.  "xor" only returns true if EXACTLY one of the two expressions evaluate to true.
```
